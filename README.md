# Mykal Learns Kubernetes ðŸš¢

This repo is to store learning resources and notes from learning kubernetes. Right now my primary learning resources are [Linkedin Learn's "Getting Started with Kubernetes" learning path](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-with-kubernetes?u=247569634) which contains 6 courses and 9 hours of video. 

This repo will be organized with a folder for each "course" to keep my notes organized.
